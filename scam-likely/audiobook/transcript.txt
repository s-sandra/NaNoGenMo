Eight cubic yards of concrete into one of these forms, the smallest of which is twentytwo by twentyfive feet, only filled that form up about three or four inches deep. So there goes that story you may have heard, that there are workers buried in the concrete here. Couldn't possibly happen. But what they did bury in that freshly poured concrete, was oneinch steel water pipe. They came down here in this lower cofferdam, and they built an ice plant. Capable of making a thousand tons of ice a day. They used that ice, to chill the water, that they forced through that pipe in this newly placed concrete. As concrete hardens, or cures as we call it, it produces heat. The more you can control that heat, the better job of curing you're going to get.
